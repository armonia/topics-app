# hub-bridge Specification

## Purpose
Topics shows the usage hub (:3360) and switchboard (:3335) without copying their APIs: a proxy for requests and one server-side reader that pushes the live data on the Topics WebSocket. Plan: `~/.claude/jarvis/docs/hub-in-topics.md`, track 0.

## Requirements
### Requirement: HUBBR-01 — Proxy to the hub and to switchboard

The server SHALL forward `/api/hub/<rest>` to `<hub>/api/<rest>` and `/api/switchboard/<rest>` to `<switchboard>/api/<rest>`, query string included, forwarding only `content-type`, `accept` and `last-event-id`.

#### Scenario: A request reaches the configured host only
- **GIVEN** a path whose rest contains `%`, `//`, a leading `/` or a dot segment
- **WHEN** it reaches the bridge
- **THEN** the bridge SHALL answer 400 without any upstream request

#### Scenario: A failure never reads as data
- **GIVEN** the hub is down, slow past the headers timeout, or answers a redirect
- **WHEN** a panel asks through the bridge
- **THEN** the answer SHALL be 502 (down, redirect) or 504 (timeout) with the reason, never an empty 200

#### Scenario: No real hub under e2e
- **GIVEN** `TOPICS_E2E=1` and no `TOPICS_HUB_URL`
- **WHEN** a request reaches the bridge
- **THEN** it SHALL answer 503 and never call :3360

### Requirement: HUBBR-02 — Live hub data on the WebSocket

The server SHALL read `/api/pace`, `/api/mac` and `/api/services` from the hub while at least one window is connected, and broadcast a `hub:live` frame per topic only when its answer changed, or once when the topic stops being readable.

#### Scenario: Unchanged data costs no frame
- **GIVEN** a tick already pushed the three topics
- **WHEN** the next tick reads the same answers
- **THEN** no frame SHALL be sent

#### Scenario: Hub down drops the old numbers
- **GIVEN** the hub stops answering
- **WHEN** the next tick runs
- **THEN** one `hub:live` frame with `error` and no `data` SHALL be sent per topic, and `GET /api/hub-live` SHALL report the error instead of the last numbers

### Requirement: HUBBR-03 — Live hub data in the client

The client SHALL keep the latest `hub:live` reading per topic, seed it once from `GET /api/hub-live`, and never let an older reading replace a newer one.

#### Scenario: Seed after a frame
- **GIVEN** a frame at time 20 was adopted
- **WHEN** a seed reading at time 10 arrives
- **THEN** the store SHALL keep the reading at time 20
